Plan for going about Babushka:
-Need to have figured out the main gameplay things before you go all out on the art direction and drawing sprites
-Temp art:
	-For main charachter, do the absolute simplest thing possible that just barely communicates the action (but is still a sprite animation, allows you to figure out that system)
	-For enemies: Just need to have roughly the right shape, not to look like they will in the final product
	-Figure out inside the game the right proportions for the hitboxes and attacks and such
-For level design and tiles:
	-Do make some moodboards and lists of possible settings you'll be exploring in the game
	-Find tilesets you can use to start designing the levels (without thinking much about aesthetics at all)
	-Actually start designing sort of the whole level / game, first roughly on paper, then in tiled or something. 
	-You can do this while working on implementing all the mechanics we'll need in the actual game programming / engine.
	-Also, at the same time, work on figuring out more about the art direction and the sprites and tiles we'll need for the game (and work on getting better at pixel art and shading, because you can't leave all that for last, you're not good at doing art stuff many hours a day!)
	
Pixel art exercises:
-Try drawing a few insects
-Try drawing a few animals
-Try drawing some plants
-Try finding various textures and figuring out how to represent them with just a few pixels
-Find some pixel shading exercises, representing different surfaces with pixels (try out first maybe just a simple sphere with different sources of light)
-Make a rotating coin!

Don't focus too much on animation and proportions, as there won't really be that many in the final game either way. It'll just all look a little scuffed probably, and be hard to do.
